We are tremendously excited to announce the release of [Snowplow R101 Neapolis][release-notes].
This realtime release marks the first step in our journey towards making Snowplow
[Google Cloud Platform][gcp]-native, evolving it into a truly multi-cloud platform.

Read on for more information on R101 Neapolis, named after
[the archeological site in Sicily, Italy where the Greek theatre of Syracuse is located][neapolis]:

<h2 id="why">1. Why bring Google Cloud Platform support to Snowplow?</h2>

Historically, the Snowplow platform has been closely tied to Amazon Web Services and to a lesser
extent on-premise (largely through Apache Kafka support). In order to make the platform accessible
to all, it is important to make it as cloud-agnostic as possible.

This process begins with porting the realtime pipeline to Google Cloud Platform, the hugely popular
public cloud offering - and this release is the first step on this journey.

The next releases on our journey to GCP will focus on porting the streaming enrichment process to
[Google Cloud Dataflow][dataflow] and making loading Snowplow events into [BigQuery][bq] a reality.

For more information regarding our overall plans for Google Cloud Platform, please check out our
[RFC][rfc] on the subject.

<h2 id="gcp-delta">2. Adding GCP support to Stream Collector and Stream Enrich</h2>

To those familiar with the current Snowplow streaming pipeline achitecture, this release will look
straightforward: we simply take our existing components and add support for *publishing* and
*subscribing* to [Google Cloud PubSub][pubsub] topics.

Specifically, we took our Scala Stream Collector and added support for publishing raw Snowplow
events to a [Google Cloud PubSub][pubsub] topic. Similarly, we updated our Stream Enrich component
to read those raw events off Google Cloud PubSub, enrich them and publish them back to another
PubSub topic.

We have written dedicated guides to setting up those micro-services in the following wiki articles:

- [Getting started guide][getting-started]
- [Setting up the Scala Stream Collector on GCP][ssc-setup-guide]
- [Setting up Stream Enrich on GCP][se-setup-guide]

Huge thanks to our former intern, [Guilherme Pires][colobas], for laying the foundations for this
release.

<h2 id="split">3. Dedicated artifacts for each platform</h2>

As we go multi-cloud and support a growing number of different platforms, it is becoming increasingly important
to split the different artifacts according to their targeted streaming technology, in order to:

1. Keep the JAR sizes from getting out of hand
2. Prevent a combinatorial explosion of different source and sink technologies requiring testing
(e.g. Amazon Kinesis source to Google Cloud PubSub sink)

Therefore, from this release onwards, there will be five different artifacts for the Scala Stream
Collector, and five for Stream Enrich.


**For the Scala Stream Collector:**

    <tr>
      <td>snowplow-stream-enrich-stdin-<em>version</em>.jar</td>
      <td>stdin/stdout</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


This approach reduces artifact size and simplifies testing, at the cost of some flexibility for
Stream Enrich. If you were previously running a "hybrid-cloud" Stream Enrich (reading and writing to
different streaming technologies), then we suggest setting up a dedicated app downstream of Stream
Enrich to bridge the enriched events to the other stream system.

<h2 id="misc">4. Miscellaneous changes</h2>

<h3 id="jmx">4.1 Exposing the number of requests made to the collector through JMX</h3>

Thanks to [GitHub user jspc][jspc], the Scala Stream Collector now exposes some valuable metrics
through [JMX][jmx] via the new MBean `com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow:type=StreamCollector`,
containing the following attributes:

- `Requests`: total number of requests
- `SuccessfulRequests`: total number of successful requests
- `FailedRequests`: total number of failed requests

You can turn on JMX by launching the collector in the following manner:

{% highlight bash %}
java \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9010 \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \
  -jar snowplow-stream-collector-google-pubsub-0.13.0.jar --config config.hocon
{% endhighlight %}

For more information on setting JMX up, refer to [this guide][jmx-setup].

<h3 id="kafka">4.2 Upgrading to Kafka 1.0.1</h3>

We've taken advantage of this release to upgrade the Kafka artifacts to Kafka 1.0.1.

<h2 id="upgrading">5. Upgrading</h2>

<h3 id="upg-ssc">5.1 Scala Stream Collector</h3>

The latest version of the Scala Stream Collector is available from our Bintray [here][ssc].

A complete setup guide for running the Scala Stream Collector on GCP can be found in the following
guides:

- [The getting started guide][getting-started]
- [The Scala Stream Collector setup guide][ssc-setup-guide]

<h4 id="upg-ssc-conf">5.1.1 Updating the configuration</h4>

For non-Google Cloud PubSub users, the only minor change was made to the `collector.crossDomain`
section: it's now non-optional but has an `enabled` flag:

{% highlight yaml %}
crossDomain {
  enabled = false
  domain = "acme.com"
  secure = true
}
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you want to leverage Google Cloud PubSub, you'll need to change the
`collector.streams.sink` section to something akin to the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
sink {
  enabled = googlepubsub
  googleProjectId = ID
  # values are in milliseconds
  backoffPolicy {
    minBackoff = 50
    maxBackoff = 1000
    totalBackoff = 10000 # must be >= 10000
    multiplier = 2
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

For a complete example, see [our sample config.hocon template][ssc-config].

If you're running the collector from a GCP instance in the same project, authentication will be
transparently taken care of for you.

If not, you'll need to run the following to authenticate using [GCP's CLI gcloud][gcloud]:

{% highlight bash %}
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
{% endhighlight %}

Regarding `backoffPolicy`, if sinking a raw event to PubSub fails, the first retry will happen after
`minBackoff` milliseconds. For the following failures, this backoff will be multiplied by
`multiplier` each time until it reaches `maxBackoff` milliseconds, its cap. If the sum of the time
spent backing off exceeds `totalBackoff` milliseconds, the application will shut down.

<h4 id="upg-ssc-launch">5.1.2 Launching</h4>

As explained in [section 3](#split), there is now one JAR per platform, as such you'll need to
use one of the following commands to launch the collector:

{% highlight bash %}
java -jar snowplow-stream-collector-google-pubsub-0.13.0.jar --config config.hocon
java -jar snowplow-stream-collector-kinesis-0.13.0.jar --config config.hocon
java -jar snowplow-stream-collector-kafka-0.13.0.jar --config config.hocon
java -jar snowplow-stream-collector-nsq-0.13.0.jar --config config.hocon
java -jar snowplow-stream-collector-stdout-0.13.0.jar --config config.hocon
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="upg-se">5.2 Stream Enrich</h3>

The latest version of Stream Enrich is available from our Bintray [here][se].

A complete setup guide for running Stream Enrich on GCP can be found in the following guides:

- [The getting started guide][getting-started]
- [The Stream Enrich setup guide][se-setup-guide]

<h4 id="upg-se-conf">5.2.1 Updating the configuration</h4>

Configuration for Stream Enrich has been remodeled in order to only allow a source and a sink
on the same platform and, for example, disallow reading events from a Kafka topic and writing out
enriched events to a Kinesis stream.

As such, the configuration, if you're using Kinesis, now looks like:

{% highlight yaml %}
enrich {
  streams {
    in { ... }                         # UNCHANGED
    out { ... }                        # UNCHANGED
    sourceSink {                       # NEW SECTION
      enabled = kinesis
      region = eu-west-1
      aws {
        accessKey = iam
        secretKey = iam
      }
      maxRecords = 10000
      initialPosition = TRIM_HORIZON
      backoffPolicy {
        minBackoff = 50
        maxBackoff = 1000
      }
    }
    buffer { ... }                     # UNCHANGED
    appName = ""                       # UNCHANGED
  }
  monitoring { ... }                   # UNCHANGED
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to leverage Google Cloud PubSub, it should look like the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
enrich {
  streams {
    in { ... }                         # UNCHANGED
    out { ... }                        # UNCHANGED
    sourceSink {                       # NEW SECTION
      enabled = googlepubsub
      googleProjectId = id
      threadPoolSize = 4
      backoffPolicy {
        minBackoff = 50
        maxBackoff = 1000
        totalBackoff = 10000 # must be >= 10000
        multiplier = 2
      }
    }
    buffer { ... }                     # UNCHANGED
    appName = ""                       # UNCHANGED
  }
  monitoring { ... }                   # UNCHANGED
}
{% endhighlight %}

`multiplier` each time until it reaches `maxBackoff` milliseconds, its cap. If the sum of the time
spent backing off exceeds `totalBackoff` milliseconds, the application will shut down.

`threadPoolSize` refers to the number of threads available to the
[PubSub Subscriber][subscriber-doc].

<h4 id="upg-se-launch">5.2.2 Launching</h4>

Same as for the collector, there is now one JAR per targeted platform:

{% highlight bash %}
java -jar snowplow-stream-enrich-google-pubsub-0.15.0.jar --config config.hocon --resolver file:iglu.json
java -jar snowplow-stream-enrich-kinesis-0.15.0.jar --config config.hocon --resolver file:iglu.json
java -jar snowplow-stream-enrich-kafka-0.15.0.jar --config config.hocon --resolver file:iglu.json
java -jar snowplow-stream-enrich-nsq-0.15.0.jar --config config.hocon --resolver file:iglu.json
java -jar snowplow-stream-enrich-stdin-0.15.0.jar --config config.hocon --resolver file:iglu.json
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="roadmap">6. Roadmap</h2>

Upcoming Snowplow releases will include:

* [R102 Afontova Gora][r102-bat], various stability, security and data quality improvements for the
  batch pipeline
* [R103 [STR] PII Enrichment phase 2][r103-pii], enhancing our recently-released GDPR-focused PII
  Enrichment for the realtime pipeline
* [R10x [STR & BAT] IP Lookups Enrichment upgrade][r156-ip], moving us away from
  using the legacy MaxMind database format, which is being sunsetted on 2nd April 2018

Furthermore, this release is only the beginning for Google Cloud Platform support in Snowplow!

As discussed in our RFC, we plan on porting our streaming enrichment process to
[Google Cloud Dataflow][dataflow], leveraging the [Apache Beam APIs][beam] (see
[this milestone][r151-beam] for details). In parallel, we are also busy designing our new Snowplow
event loader for [BigQuery][bq].

We look forward to your feedback as we continue to roll out and extend our GCP capabilities!
